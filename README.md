### Estufa esp8266

The estufa_esp8266 project is designed to automate humidity control in a greenhouse using an ESP8266 microcontroller, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and a cooling fan. The ESP8266 continuously monitors humidity levels and activates the cooler when the humidity exceeds a set threshold. This project aims to provide an affordable, energy-efficient solution for maintaining optimal greenhouse conditions.

Components
ESP8266: Microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi for monitoring and controlling the greenhouse environment.
DHT11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity levels in the greenhouse.
Cooling Fan: Activates to reduce humidity when it exceeds a predefined threshold.
